This is just for fun. I don't see why this would ever be useful and
it'll probably remain incomplete or limited.

## Testing

You can write tests in any module using the `test` keyword. For example:

```gleam
test foo() {
  1 + 1 == 2
}
```

To run all tests, simply do:

```sh
aiken check
```

To run only tests matching the string `foo`, do:

```sh
aiken check -m foo
```

## Documentation

If you're writing a library, you might want to generate an HTML documentation for it.

Use:

```sh
aiken docs
```
